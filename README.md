AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks. 

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i tagger` or `appman -i tagger`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install tagger.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install tagger`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)

## Known quirks

- Help page only works if `gnome-help` or other similar `.page` viewer is installed on the host's system.  
Bundling the help page viewer in the AppImage would make it work everywhere, but it's both bad for the file size and [security](https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2025/04/15/dangerous-arbitrary-file-read-vulnerability-in-yelp-cve-2025-3155/), hence why we don't do that.
  - `gnome-help` v49.0 doesn't work with Help section of our GTK AppImages for some reason, while older versions, like v42.3 work.
